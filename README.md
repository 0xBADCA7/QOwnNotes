# QOwnNotes
 
QOwnNotes is a note editor, written in Qt 5, that works together with the notes application of [ownCloud](http://owncloud.org/).

The notes are stored as plain text files and are synced with ownCloud's file sync functionality. Of course other software, like Dropbox can be used too.

I like the concept of having notes accessible in plain text files, like it is done in the ownCloud note app, but I was not able to find a decent desktop note taking tool or a text editor, that handles them well. Out of this need QOwnNotes was born.

This application is still under heavy development, so I constantly will come up with new features.

## Current features
- notes can be created, edited, viewed and removed
- list of notes is showed, sorted my modification date descending
- a notes folder can be chosen
- sub-string searching of notes is possible
- can be operated with keyboard
- external changes of note files are watched (notes or note list are reloaded)

## Upcoming features
- renaming notes
- and much more...
